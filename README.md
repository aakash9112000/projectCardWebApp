**Card Management**

Implemented a feature allowing users to create, edit, and delete cards. Each card contains two fields: a name and a video or MP3 link.
**Bucket Functionality**

Created a system where cards are organized into customizable buckets (e.g., "Entertainment Videos" and "Educational Videos"). Users can create and name buckets according to their preferences.
**Card Operations**

Enabled card movement between buckets, allowing users to manage card organization easily. Integrated a modal window that opens upon clicking a card, displaying an embedded video or MP3 via an iframe for smooth playback.
**Bulk Deletion**

Added the ability for users to delete one or multiple cards simultaneously from any bucket for easy management.
**History Tab**

Developed a dedicated "History" tab that tracks previously played media. It displays the card name, video/MP3 link, and a timestamp for each played media item.
**Login Functionality**

**Signup Functionality**

Implemented a simple user authentication system. Users can only access card and bucket management features after logging in, adding a layer of security.
